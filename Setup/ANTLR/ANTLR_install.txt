INITIAL SETUP:
1. Install Java from JavaSetup8u391.exe (must be 1.7 or higher).
2. Place antlr-4.9.2-complete.jar to any folder (can even be this one), e.g. "D:\Program Files\ANLTR\".
3. Create subfolder named 'output' in that folder.
4. If environment variable CLASSPATH does not exist on your system, create it.
5. Append to it the path to the jar file from step 2, e.g. "D:\Program Files\ANLTR\antlr-4.9.2-complete.jar".
RUNNING ANTLR:
1. Place the grammar file(.g4 from "AnimArch\Assets\Scripts\AnimationControl\OAL") into the same directory as the jar file, e.g. "D:\Program Files\ANLTR\".
2. Start CMD in the same directory as the jar file, e.g. "D:\Program Files\ANLTR\".
3. In CMD, run the following command: java -jar "antlr-4.9.2-complete.jar" -visitor -listener -Werror -o ".\output" -Dlanguage=CSharp "OAL.g4"
USING WHAT YOU HAVE CREATED:
1. Copy all content of the 'output' folder (from step 3) into "AnimArch\Assets\Scripts\AnimationControl\OAL\AutoGenerated".
2. If new rule was created, modify "AnimArch\Assets\Scripts\AnimationControl\OAL\OALVisitorConcrete.cs" accordingly.

    Install Java (version 1.7 or higher)
    Download antlr-4.9.2-complete.jar (or whatever version) from https://github.com/antlr/website-antlr4/blob/gh-pages/download/antlr-4.9.2-complete.jar OR https://www.antlr.org/download.html Save to your directory for 3rd party Java libraries, say C:\Javalib
    Add antlr-4.9.2-complete.jar to CLASSPATH, either:

    Permanently: Using System Properties dialog > Environment variables > Create or append to CLASSPATH variable
    Temporarily, at command line:


https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33273414/how-can-i-get-lexer-and-parser-with-antlr-for-c

Download the jar file.

Save it to C:\Test

Add the jar to your classpath:

Using System Properties dialog > Environment variables > Create or append to CLASSPATH variable

In the variable, put C:\Test\antlr-runtime-4.9.2.jar If values already exist for this variable, insert a ; before your new entry

Copy in your grammar file to C:\Test

Go to the command line, navigate to C:\Test

Create your 'outputdirectory' folder, and run this (remember to replace {outputdirectory} and {input}:

java org.antlr.v4.Tool -o -visitor -no-listener -Werror -o {outputdirectory} -Dlanguage=CSharp {input}.g4
